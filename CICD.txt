1. Changes are made in taufik_dev and PRâ€™d to dev.

2. CI/CD builds the project and runs tests.

3. Once PR is merged into dev, the pipeline builds Docker images and pushes them to Azure Container Registry.

4. The code is then merged into staging, where the process repeats, and a tag like v1.0.0-rc.1 is created.

5. When PR is merged into main, the pipeline will:

6. Build Docker image and push to ACR.

7. Create a version tag on main (e.g., v1.1.0).

8. Automatically create a release for version v1.1.0 on GitHub, mentioning the previous version.

9. You can also optionally upload artifacts like .zip files, built binaries, or Docker images to the release.
